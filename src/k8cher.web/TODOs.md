Account items to get working:
* Change password
* Forgot password

* need to align minimum password with client/server (could this be done by using webassembly in each?). Just have server side validate and client side show message?

* the confirm password on register behaves differnt than password leaving wierd user experience when register fails

* // todo - mbk: add a custom log that will log to console for 'dev' environment an option to send logs to server

* Add cypress and jest
https://www.cypress.io/
jest has jest.conf.cjs

* In app.html add manifest.json like hipster?
